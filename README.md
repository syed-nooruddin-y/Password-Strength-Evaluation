# Password-Strength-Evaluation
Overview  This  demonstration is used to know  the password complexity, length, and unpredictability affect overall security. Three sample passwords were tested using an online strength checker, and observations were recorded to understand best practices, common attacks, and effective password-creation strategies.


# Tested Passwords & Observations
1) kali#@231
Strength: Weak / Medium
Issues:
Only 9 characters
Contains dictionary word “kali”
Predictable pattern
Conclusion: Needs more length and randomness.

2) password@2468
Strength: Very Weak
Issues:
Uses extremely common word “password”
Easily guessable
Conclusion: Not secure even with symbols and numbers.

3) task^#@*)0$!%1
Strength: Strong
Strength Points:
Long length
Many symbols
Good randomness


# Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

Use 12–16+ characters for stronger resistance.
Avoid dictionary words, names, or common phrases.
Use a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Prefer random strings or passphrases (3–4 unrelated words).
Never reuse passwords across accounts.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA).
Store passwords in a password manager instead of memorizing.
Avoid predictable patterns like P@ssw0rd, Name@123.

Conclusion: Strongest among all three.


#Tips Learned From Evaluation
Short passwords become weak even with symbols.
Dictionary words drastically lower the strength score.
Increasing length improves strength more than adding symbols.
Random passwords always score higher.
Passphrases can be both strong and easy to remember.

# Common Password Attacks
1. Brute Force Attack

Attacker tries every possible character combination.
Longer & more complex passwords dramatically increase cracking time.

2. Dictionary Attack

Attacker uses wordlists or leaked password lists.
Any password containing real words (e.g., “password”, “kali”) is vulnerable.

3.Hybrid Attacks

Mix dictionary words with numbers/symbols.
Example: “password123”, “admin@2024”, “kali@231”.


# How Password Complexity Affects Security

Length increases security exponentially.
Character variety increases possible combinations.
Unpredictability reduces attack success.
Dictionary-based passwords are cracked fastest.
Unique passwords ensure one breach doesn’t affect all accounts.
Combining length + randomness offers the best protection.

#Conclusion

Password security depends heavily on:
Length
Randomness
Character diversity
Avoiding predictable patterns
Using strong, unique passwords and enabling MFA significantly improves your protection against cyber attacks.
